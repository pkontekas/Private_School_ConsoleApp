# Private_School_ConsoleApp
Full Console application in Java for a private School.

Database in mySQL was also made from scratch with the appropriate Relationships/constraints.
JDBC was used in this application, for making changes to the database, and all appropriate validations for the user input in the console app.

The database may be recreated with the SQL file "private_school_Full_Export_SQL_pk.SQL" in home/root directory in github, with workbench or any other client you see fit!

A diagram with the database entities can be also found in home/root directory with the name "privateSchool_PK_diagram"! Enjoy!

Made in May 2020 for Coding Bootcamp 10 - Peoplecert as an assignment.
